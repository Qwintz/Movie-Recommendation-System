# Movie Recommendation System



The Movie Recommendation System based on Collaborative Filtering is a project developed as part of the "Artificial Intelligence" course. It is written in Python and utilizes datasets from MovieLens. The system leverages collaborative filtering algorithms to analyze user ratings and preferences and generate personalized movie recommendations. By studying patterns and relationships among users, it can suggest movies that are likely to align with a user's interests. Users have the ability to create profiles, rate movies, and receive tailored recommendations based on their individual tastes. The system aims to enhance the movie-watching experience by providing users with relevant and enjoyable movie suggestions.
